Welcome to the "Large Multimodal Model Prompting with Gemini" course! 🚀 Unlock the potential of Gemini for integrating text, images, and videos in your applications.

## 📘 Course Summary
Multimodal models like Gemini are breaking new ground by unifying traditionally siloed data modalities. 🖼️📝📹 With Gemini, you can create applications that understand and reason across text, images, and videos. For instance, you might build a virtual interior designer that analyzes room images and text descriptions to generate personalized design recommendations, or a smart document processing pipeline that extracts data from PDFs and generates summaries.

**What You’ll Learn:**
1. 📊 **Introduction to Gemini Models**: Explore the Gemini model family, including Nano, Pro, Flash, and Ultra. Learn to select the right model based on capabilities, latency, and cost considerations.
2. 🔍 **Multimodal Prompting and Parameter Control**: Master advanced techniques for structuring text-image-video prompts. Fine-tune parameters like temperature, top_p, and top_k to balance creativity and determinism.
3. 🛠️ **Best Practices for Multimodal Prompting**: Gain hands-on experience with prompt engineering, role assignment, task decomposition, and formatting. Understand the impact of prompt-image ordering on performance.
4. 🏡 **Creating Use Cases with Images**: Build applications such as interior design assistants and receipt itemization tools. Utilize Gemini’s cross-modal reasoning to analyze relationships between entities across images.
5. 🎥 **Developing Use Cases with Videos**: Implement semantic video search and long-form video QA. Explore content summarization techniques using Gemini’s large context window.
6. 🔗 **Integrating Real-Time Data with Function Calling**: Enhance Gemini with live data and external knowledge through function calling and API integration. Combine NLU capabilities with APIs for interactive services.
